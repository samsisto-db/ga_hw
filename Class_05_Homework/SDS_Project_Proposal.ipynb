    "The data that I plan to use to answer that question will come from the Yelp API. Scraping webpages/APIs is something that I have never done before, but after learning more about this from class this past week it's something that I would like to experiment with. By choosing a small subset of restaurants in a given area, I can scrape the reviews from the Yelp API to get information about users preferences. Once I have gathered enough data from the Yelp API, I can start to dig into the data further and see what that tells us about user preferences and what restaurants they may be likely to try."

    "After examining the Yelp API and asociated documentation, I've determined that we can get reviews that users write about a given restaurant through the API. Upon further inspection, it seems as though you can only retrieve up to 3 reviews from a particular business. But there are academic datasets that Yelp makes available for projects like the one that I am pursuing. Over the next few days, I am going to explore getting access to the academic data sets that Yelp makes available. "
